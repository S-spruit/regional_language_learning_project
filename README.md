# regional language learning project
This is yet another random idea that came to mind once, and it's once again a pretty good one! Nowadays very few people speak dialects in the netherlands, more and more things are becoming ABN while dialects are part of our culture. creating a webapp to learn people dialects would be great and that's exactly what this project is for!

Here's what's the plan so far:
- short lessons divided in sections
- scoreboards
- profile pages
- West-fries as first dialect
